Books and Movies Recommendation System
Overview
This project implements a recommendation system for both books and movies. The books recommendation system utilizes collaborative filtering and popularity-based filtering, providing users with personalized suggestions. On the other hand, the movies recommendation system employs a content-based approach using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

Features
Books Recommendation System
Collaborative Filtering: Recommends books based on user preferences and behaviors, leveraging collaborative filtering algorithms.
Popularity-based Filtering: Recommends popular books that appeal to a broader audience.
Movies Recommendation System
Content-Based Filtering: Recommends movies based on the content analysis of textual data, incorporating Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.
Technologies Used
Python: The core programming language for the entire project.
Scikit-learn: Used for implementing machine learning algorithms, including collaborative filtering.
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): Utilized for NLP tasks in the movies recommendation system.
Streamlit: A Python library for creating web interfaces. It's used to merge and present the recommendations in an interactive and user-friendly way.
